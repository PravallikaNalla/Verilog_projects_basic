A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
reffered to in the code as
Fn = Fn_1 + Fn_2

2 registers which store the previous 2 numbers in the sequence
add these two number and push the result to update registers
